<div class="fontbg"><b>Function overloading -</b></div><br>

Function overloading is a feature in C++ where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters.
Function overloading can be considered as an example of polymorphism feature in C++.

<div class="fontbg"><u>Example:</u></div>
<div class="bgcolor">
<PRE class="pre2">
<code>
#include &#60;iostream>
using namespace std; 

void print(int i) 
{ 
  cout &#60;&#60; " Here is int " &#60;&#60; i &#60; endl; 
} 
void print(double  f)
{ 
  cout &#60;&#60; " Here is float " &#60;&#60; f &#60;&#60; endl; 
} 
void print(char const *c)
{ 
  cout &#60;&#60; " Here is char* " &#60;&#60; c &#60;&#60; endl; 
} 
int main() 
{ 
  print(10); 
  print(10.10); 
  print("ten"); 
  return 0; 
}
Output:
Here is int 10 
Here is float 10
Here is char* ten
Here, there are 3 print functions. Depending upon the type of input provided to the functions, that specific function is implemented.

<div class="fontbg"><b>Operator overloading -</b></div><br>
In C++, it's possible to change the way operator works (for user-defined types). 
The meaning of an operator is always same for variable of basic types like: int, float, double etc. For example: To add two integers, + operator is used.
However, for user-defined types (like: objects), you can redefine the way operator works. 
For example:
If there are two objects of a class that contains string as its data members. You can redefine the meaning of + operator and use it to concatenate those strings.
This feature in C++ programming that allows programmer to redefine the meaning of an operator (when they operate on class objects) is known as operator overloading.
<br><br>
<div class="fontbg"><u>Syntax:</u></div>
<div id="border">To overload an operator :<br>
return_type operator_symbol (arguments)</div><br>
Here, returnType is the return type of the function.
The returnType of the function is followed by operator keyword.
<br>Symbol is the operator symbol you want to overload. Like: +,-,*. You can pass arguments to the operator function in similar way as functions.

<div class="bgcolor">
<PRE class="pre2">
<code>
#include&#60;iostream> 
using namespace std; 
  
class Complex 
{ 
private: 
    int real, imag; 
public: 
    Complex(int r = 0, int i =0)  {real = r;   imag = i;} 
      
    // This is automatically called when '+' is used with 
    // between two Complex objects 
    Complex operator + (Complex const &obj) { 
         Complex res; 
         res.real = real + obj.real; 
         res.imag = imag + obj.imag; 
         return res; 
    } 
    void print() { cout &#60;&#60; real &#60;&#60; " + i" &#60;&#60; imag &#60;&#60; endl; } 
}; 
int main() 
{ 
    Complex c1(10, 5), c2(2, 4); 
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2; // An example call to "operator+" 
    c3.print(); 
} 
Output:
12 + i9

Almost all operators can be overloaded except few. Following is the list of operators that cannot be overloaded.
<br>. (dot) 
<br>:: (Scope Resolution)
<br>?: (Ternary Operator)
<br>sizeof
