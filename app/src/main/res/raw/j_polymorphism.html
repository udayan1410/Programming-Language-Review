<div class="fontbg"><b>Java polymorphism:</b><br></div>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.<br>
<br>
There are two types of polymorphism in Java:<br>
1. Compile-time polymorphism <br>
2. Runtime polymorphism. <br>
We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.<br>
1. Java Compile time polymorphism: Compile time polymorphism or static method dispatch is a process in which a call to an overloading method is resolved at compile time rather than at run time. In this process, we done overloading of methods is called through the reference variable of a class here no need to superclass.<br>
<div class="fontbg"><u>Example :</u></div>
 <div class="bgcolor">
<PRE class="pre2">
<code>
class Calculation{
  void sum(int a,int b)
  {
     System.out.println(a+b);
  }
  void sum(int a,int b,int c){
     System.out.println(a+b+c);
   }

  public static void main(String args[]){
  Calculation obj=new Calculation();
  obj.sum(10,10,10);
  obj.sum(20,20);

  }
}

Output:
30
40
</code>
</pre>
</div>
<br>
2. Java Runtime polymorphism: Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.<br>
<div class="fontbg"><u>Example :</u></div>
 <div class="bgcolor">
<PRE class="pre2">
<code>
class Bike{  
  void run(){System.out.println("running");}  
}  
class Splendor extends Bike{  
  void run(){System.out.println("running safely with 60km");}  
  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
    Bike b = new Splendor();//upcasting  
    b.run();  
  }  
}

Output: running safely with 60km.

<div style="color:red;">Important points:<br>
1. An object in Java that passes more than one IS-A tests is polymorphic in nature.<br>

2. Every object in Java passes a minimum of two IS-A tests: one for itself and one for Object class.<br>

3. Static polymorphism in Java is achieved by method overloading.<br>

4. Dynamic polymorphism in Java is achieved by method overriding.<br>
